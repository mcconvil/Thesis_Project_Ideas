# Thesis Project Ideas

* **Prediction of rare events**
    + In my work with the US Forest Inventory and Analysis Program, we are trying to detect annual changes in the landscape, such as land being converted from forest to agriculture.  Unfortunately, this is a difficult classification problem because changes are fairly rare and therefore, the a model which predicts no change for all plots of land will have a high accuracy rate (while not being very useful).  There are many ways you could explore this issue:
        + Oversampling/Undersampling
        + Penalized methods
        + Cost-sensitive algorithms
    + One vision for this project would be to learn about these various techniques and conduct an empirical analysis of their applicability to forestry data.    

* Time series with measurement error
    + Detecting trends in land use for data with measurement error

* Forestry Research

* Survey sampling

* Voter id issues
    + Construct and implement a sampling design.  
    + Learn survey estimation procedures to analyze data.
