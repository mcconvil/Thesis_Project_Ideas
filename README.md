# Thesis Project Ideas

My main areas of expertise are survey statistics and statistical/machine learning.  In my own research, I adapt statistical learning techniques, such as lasso, penalized splines, and regression trees, to handle data collected under a complex sampling design (think stratification and clustering).  

Many of the projects listed below have been generated by my work with the [US Forest Inventory and Analysis Program](https://www.fia.fs.fed.us/) (FIA) and the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/) (BLS) and therefore include stakeholders who would have a vested interest in your work and findings!  

* **Prediction of rare events**
    + In my work with FIA, we are trying to detect annual changes in the landscape, such as land being converted from forest to agriculture.  Unfortunately, this is a difficult classification problem because from one year to the next most land doesn't change.  This extreme class imbalance greatly hinders the effectiveness of the predictive models since a model which predicts all plots of land will have no change has a high accuracy rate but isn't very useful.  Many methods have been proposed to remedy this issue: over/undersampling, penalized methods, cost-sensitive algorithms.  Which method would work best for landscape change?  One vision for this project would be to learn and write about the various remedies for class imbalance and to conduct an empirical analysis of their applicability to forestry data. 
    + A good starting point would be He and Garcia's 2009 paper [Learning from Imbalanced Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5128907/).

* **Time series with measurement error**
    + For a pilot site in Georgia, FIA has landscape data dating back several decades.  Plotting the data it is clear that forests are decreasing and are being replaced by developed land.  However, can we show this trend is statistically significant when the data itself has measurement error?  In this project, the student would learn about time series analysis and time series models which account for measurement errors in the data.  These models would then be applied to the Georgia pilot site to better understand the long term land use trends.
    + A good starting point to learn about time series analysis is in a time series textbook.  [Here's an open access text on forecasting that contains a couple of chapters on time series analysis](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/6/1).
  
    
* **Predicting outliers**
    + Item non-response is common for survey data.  This is where a particular answers some, but not all, of the survey questions.  Often, during analysis, the survey statistician would like to impute (i.e. fill-in) the missing values.  However, this imputation can be difficult for variables that are heavily right skewed, such as income, because of the impact of outliers.  In this project, the student would learn about models for predicting skewed data and would apply the techniques to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey.
    + A good starting point is Rana et. al.'s 2012 paper [Robust regression imputation for analyzing missing data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6396621/).
    
* **Statistical learning techniques**
    + Is there a statistical learning technique that you want to better understand? 
    + A good starting point is the [ISLR textbook](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/).

* **Survey analysis**
    + Want to learn how to analyze data that comes from a complex sampling design?
    + A good starting point to be added soon.
    
* **Conducting a proper survey**    
    + Want to construct a survey, implement a sampling design and then analyze the data?  For an example, see [my paper on the impacts of voter id laws](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2330443X.2017.1407721).
